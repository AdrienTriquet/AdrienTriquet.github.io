      <description>A first touch with a rocket   Actually, it was not my very first time on blender as I already learned how to do a few things on my free time. Indeed, mostly interested by software like Final Cut or the Adobe suite (Premiere, Photoshop and lightroom most of all). Blender was another tool I had to learn.
But actually, to be honest, discovering on a more strict way the effective and basic tools of this very rich software was an excellent thing for me.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this class was to build our first platformer by our own. We had been really free on the content and game design and it was such a pleaser as I never used Unity before.
  The game design   The first platform I started by the game design, experimenting different tools. I began with a simple platform with walls that hide the success area.
This simple game at first enable me to create and try my first code, to have at least a character that moves.</description>
