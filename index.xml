      <description>After two labs of set-up, let&amp;rsquo;s create a game ! I picked &amp;lsquo;Roll a ball&amp;rsquo; and I followed all the different steps to finish with my own game.
Here was the beginning of the project.
Everything went well. Some part of the learning was already acquired through our &amp;lsquo;Computer Graphics&amp;rsquo; class.
After a quite long waiting, I had been able to play my own designed game !
Look at this amazing blue.</description>

      <description>Setting up the unity 3D environment has been a pretty easy task. The harder was to apply to the github student program. That way it became possible to download a full version of Unity.
Then, I had to downloaded modules : Visual studio was needed of course. I commonly use the jetbrain API to work. However, Visual Studio is perfectly implemented with Unity, so I discovered this software.
Moreover, as an Iphone user, I had to download the Android build Support and to emulate on Mac an Android OS to test my future applications.</description>

      <description>Here I will present a new input device.
Almost everything changed after this COVID crisis but I had not talked about it yet ! Then, I want to highlight the case of :
waterproof keyboards Situation Indeed, in every workspace, class and of course medical center, the current issue about infection is everywhere. Our utilisation of computers has changed. It is now more complicated to lend devices. The most relevant examples are keyboards.</description>

      <description>1965 - Ivan Sutherland writes &amp;lsquo;The Ultimate Display&amp;rsquo;. As depicted by this picture, he had a huge understanding and foreseeing of what could be the future of technology. His system was not as design as google glasses, but nonetheless the idea was already there. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look to his ideas through his words.
He started with a description of what already exist in 1965. I will now highlight some of his sentences.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick definition of dark pattern design : A dark pattern is a user interface that has been designed to deceive or manipulate a user. These graphic choices can also be represented as elements put in place to solicit the user for a longer period and ensure that the latter stays on a service using cognitive biases. (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern)

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick definition of Gestalt Principles : Gestalt Principles are principles/laws of human perception that describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. Designers use the principles to organize content on websites and other interfaces so it is pleasing and easy to understand. (https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles)
Let&amp;rsquo;s discover application of those laws that went wrong !

      <description>This page aims to show one good and one bad affordance in our daily life.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick definition of affordance : A situation where an objectâ€™s sensory characteristics intuitively imply its functionality and use. (https://blog.prototypr.io/affordance-and-its-future-in-designing-interfaces-973a48ae8a0)
  Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a good one :   It is difficult to find a device that we use alone for the first time. Indeed, its affordance is, I think, biased as soon as someone shows you how a thing works.</description>

      <description>This first lab aims to give us tools. Therefore, I started to fill and create my blog. I chose to use Hugo as advised by our teachers.
Process I use the quick start of Hugo to create my project. As a mac user, I am used to homebrew and no difficulty occurred : https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ All me modifications were then made with Jetbrain&amp;rsquo;s IDE : PHP Storm.
Then, I only had to discover all the themes and to pick them.</description>
