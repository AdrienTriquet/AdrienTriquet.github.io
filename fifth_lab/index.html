                            <p><strong>For this lab, we aim to play our &lsquo;Roll a ball&rsquo; game in VR !</strong></p>
<p>To do this, I used Occulus Rift and hand command from our school in Evry. We tested them at first to be sure they were
ready. I did not face issues excepted for batteries.</p>
<p>Then came the problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="change-the-pc">Change the PC</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I made roll a ball on my PC, which is not powerful enough to be used for VR. Therefore, I copied the projects on the one
of the school. However, the versions were not the same and I had to spend time to configure it all again.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="export-roll-a-ball-in-vrtk">Export &lsquo;Roll a ball&rsquo; in VRTK</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I faced a new issue : exporting my game into our VRTK project. Indeed, many errors were raised, both in my code
and in the assets. For instance, it was all pink and / or empty.</p>
<p>I then tried many solutions, each time demanding to input again the
occulus integration. Finally, as I was unable to understand why the project worked on the computer but not in VRTK,
which still does not make sense to me, I started from scratch the missing objects / materials.</p>
<p>Then, we configure all the integration of our device in the unity project and &hellip; it worked !
At first, I was simply able to start the game and to move inside the occulus.</p>

<h4 id="one-more-issue">One more issue</h4>
<p>I also had to reboot the computer and reload the entire project as updates came out as I was working !
Indeed it worked at first and suddenlty did not because of those mandatory uptades :</p>

<h4 id="almost-done">Almost done</h4>
<p>I took some time to find the good distance to put my game from its original place in 0;0;0.
That being done, I was happy ! Everything was supposed to work and it looks perfect :</p>
<p><img src="/images/rob-vr3.jpeg" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>But no ! My game was falling in a strange direction ! Apparently another student had the same issue but it diseappered
as it appeared !</p>

</div>

<p>I started the TP from scratch after that and the modification of rigibodies enabled to solve this issue. However,
another occured :</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Here, my issue was that, even if it seemed to work, I could not move in the game of grab anything.
The interaction system was still broken.</p>
<h4 id="finally-">Finally !</h4>
<p>Actually, we finally manage to interact with our game by changing a few lines and reseting our collider boxes.
For instance, on RightTriggerAxis, the Axis Name was an issue we think !</p>

#### Some thoughts
I was very surprise to have to follow 50 slides of requirements to use such as widespread product as occulus. 
It seems there are many ways of doing it, more or less complicated, but I still think an all ready tool is needed to 
really become user-friendly.
