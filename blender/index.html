</ul>
<p>Actually, it was not my very first time on blender as I already learned how to do a few things on my free time.
Indeed, mostly interested by software like Final Cut or the Adobe suite (Premiere, Photoshop and lightroom most of all).
Blender was another tool I had to learn.</p>
<p>But actually, to be honest, discovering on a more strict way the effective and basic tools of this very rich software
was an excellent thing for me. In any case, here was the first object we made, a rocket !</p>
<p><img src="/images/rocket1.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>And I made it fly with the animation tool.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rocket2.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>I do think blender is an amazing software. I know people that uses it as a video editor.
It was then fun for me to work on project like that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="what-about-a-car">What about a car</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We then had to make a car by our own. I decided to do something in the retro-futurist trend.</p>
<p><img src="/images/car1.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p><img src="/images/car2.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>It actually took me time but I did not face major issues realizing this car.</p>
<p>I then made it go forward, and I animated also the wheels so they could turn. However, as it is a cylinder,
we cannot see it ! It could add a rim to show it but I thought it could change too much the design.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="finally--a-character">Finally : a character</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This project has been much more complicated.</p>
<p>I started with the body. The entire character is only one object extruded. In the back you can see the model.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cara1.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>The body was not a big deal. The precision was good enough so the shape stays natural to the eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="a-natural-face-">A natural face ?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most difficult for me was to create a face that does not look like a fly or an alien.
Actually, I first designed it from the side point of vu and here is what it renders :</p>
<p><img src="/images/face1.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>I found it really good !
However, here it is if you look at it another way :</p>
<p><img src="/images/face2.png" alt="GitHub Logo">
<img src="/images/face3.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>You can see there is an issue with the chin, I hope yours don&rsquo;t look like this !</p>
<p>I struggled a lot and this is the best I could do. Actually, I do think the best solution would have been to start from
scratch for the head with a more rond object to begin with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="an-issue-to-use-it">An issue to use it</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I then faced a strange error on my blender as I wanted to export the character in different formats for unity (fbx et obj).
Here it was :</p>
<p><img src="/images/error_export.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>I finally succeded in exporting it in &lsquo;mlt&rsquo; and run it in Unity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="animation">Animation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before deciding if I had to start again the character, I decided to animate it and to see if I would be able to use it
at the end in my unity game. I did animations with two techniques. First with a skeleton directly on Blender.
It enables more precision in a particular behavior I wanted to give to my character. Indeed, this enables to animate
anything with a lot of freedom, but it takes a lot of time to create something clean enough to be used.</p>
<p><img src="/images/anim1.png" alt="GitHub Logo">
<img src="/images/anim2.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>The second way was Mixamo. This Adobe online software provides characters and animation. Therefore, I uploaded my project
and created the bones in Mixamo. Finally, the results are pretty good ! I then decided to keep this solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="final-utilisation">Final utilisation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, here is what it looks like :</p>
<p><img src="/images/final_cara1.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>As it really looks like an alien, I decided to implement it in the Unity game as so !</p>
<p><img src="/images/cara_unity.png" alt="GitHub Logo"></p>
<p>If you want to discover the game and where does this other character comes from, follow the index.</p>
